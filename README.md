# README

<https://Climecloud.com> is a web application designed to add convenient functionality to 4g feature phones (Also known as dumbphones) via a lightweight dashboard.

It is primarily tested through everyday use on my Nokia 2660.

Current functionality includes route navigation via maps and weather forecasting.

This is all in a lightweight text-based format which is  sized to suit screens of 240x320px with minimal user interaction required due to the lack of touchscreen controls or a qwerty keyboard.

The next feature being implemented is a text-based news feed.
